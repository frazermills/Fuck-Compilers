# Brain Fuck Compiler:

### Introduction
This project will become a compiler that compiles brainfuck code. 

### About The Project

This project was created so that I compile my brainfuck code for a school project. The other reason I am building this project is to learn more about the brainfuck language. Why use brainfuck for a school project? you may ask, well my Computer Science teacher said that we could "implement this in the language of your choice", and hence I used brainfuck.

### Built With
* python 3
* brainfuck

#### Current features:
* Can read and process .bf files
* Can fully interpret .bf files that do not contain inputs from the user

#### Project's future features:
* Add the capabilities of accepting inputs from the user
* Refactoring code to improve efficiency
* Adding proper comments to make code more readble
* GUI interface
